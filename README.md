=========

The M in mojo is stand for MicroStrategy . It's an Javascript framework in MicroStrategy.


* [Calendar](https://github.com/biaobiaoqi/MOJODemos/tree/master/Calendar) is a straightforward calendar demo built in javascript without any 3rd-party framework.
* [FormatEditor](https://github.com/biaobiaoqi/MOJODemos/tree/master/FormatEditor) is a demo built with MOJO framwork.


Maybe some other exercise will be added here for version control. =)
